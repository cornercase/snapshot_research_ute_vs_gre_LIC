# snapshot_research_ute_vs_gre_LIC
This repository contains a snapshot of code used to assess the difference between liver iron concentration estimates made using:
 * 1.5T cartesian gradient echo
 * 3T cartesian gradient echo
 * 3T ultrashort echo time radial stack of stars
 
The repository will not be maintained as all of this code is maintained elsewhere.  This is purely a publication reference.
